# CSS Card Flip

**Requirements**: Using the starter HTML, CSS, and images, do the following:

 - Adjust the position of the  `.primary` and `.secondary` elements so that they are right on top of each other
 - Using opacity, adjust the CSS so that only `.primary` is visible
 - On hover, hide `.primary` and show `.secondary`
 - Set up a transition so that you have a smooth crossfade on hover
 - Switch your portfolio to use 3D rotations to produce a card-flip effect
